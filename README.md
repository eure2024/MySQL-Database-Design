# MySQL-Database-Design

I created sequence diagrams for a graduate System Analysis and Design course. Sequence diagrams are designed to visually model the sequential logic of a process from a use case model and/or narrative description. The diagrams are given to implementation teams or programmers to translate the instructions into code that is interpreted or compiled by a programming language. 

I also created a logical model in a graduate Principles of Database Management course that models an entity relationship diagram for a database with several interconnected tables.
