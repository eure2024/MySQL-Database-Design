The sequence diagrams were assignments in a graduate System Analysis and Design course. Sequence diagrams 'visually model the sequential logic' of a process from a use case model and/or narrative description. The diagrams are given to programmers to translate the instructions into code read by a programming language. 

The logical model is from a graduate Principles of Database Management course that models an entity relationship diagram for a relational database.
