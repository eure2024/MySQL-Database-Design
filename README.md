# MySQL-Database-Design

The sequence diagrams were part of an assignment for a graduate System Analysis and Design course. Sequence diagrams visually model the sequential logic of a process from a use case model and/or narrative description. The diagrams are given to implementation teams or programmers to translate the instructions into code that is read by a programming language. 

The logical model is from a graduate Principles of Database Management course that models an entity relationship diagram for a database with several interconnected tables.
