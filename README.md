# MySQL-Database-Design

I created the sequence diagrams for a graduate Systems Analysis and Design course. Sequence diagrams visually model the sequential logic of an action from a use case model and/or narrative description. Programmers use the diagrams to translate the instructions into code.

The logical model is from a graduate Principles of Database Management course and models an entity relationship diagram for a relational database.
